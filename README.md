# CPP_DNN
I wanted to experiment with the C++ API of PyTorch. At the time of writing this repository several of the functionalities that I used with the python API weren't available with the C++ API. So I decided to implement my own version of them.

# DataLoader

Implemented class and functionalities related to loading data.

Created generic dataset loader class.

Created CIFAR10 dataset loader class.

Created subset random sampler class.

Created data augmentation functions.
